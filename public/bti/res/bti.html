<div class="description"><b><i>You can't live your life on a bus...</i></b></div>
<div class="newline"><br></div>
<div class="location">EXT. CHURCH PARKING LOT - DAY</div>
<div class="description">A white bus opens its door and a flood of children run off laughing and screaming. After the initial burst, three girls get off laughing. After them, <b>A LITTLE BOY </b>steps off. He's walking slow and somber.</div>
<div class="description">All the parents in the parking lot are hugging and kissing their kids.&nbsp;Lots of kids are laughing.&nbsp;The Boy keeps walking until he reaches a black limousine parked at the far end.</div>
<div class="description">A chauffeur (old heavyset white guy) stands holding the door open waiting for The Boy.</div>
<div class="speaker">CHAUFFEUR</div>
<div class="dialogue">Ey! Look who it is.</div>
<div class="description">He holds out his hand for a high-five. The kid jumps, hi-fives him, and slides into the limo.</div>
<div class="description">The Boy's FATHER (Rick Ross) is sitting by the far door. The limo starts off.</div>
<div class="description">The Boy and his father sit in silence for what feels like 8 hours.</div>
<div class="speaker">FATHER</div>
<div class="dialogue">How was camp?</div>
<div class="description">The Boy "shrugs".</div>
<div class="speaker">FATHER (CONT'D)</div>
<div class="dialogue">You make any friends?</div>
<div class="speaker">THe BOY</div>
<div class="dialogue">No.</div>
<div class="description">The father laughs under his breath...but the laugh turns into a smh.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="speaker">FATHER</div>
<div class="dialogue">Elise made you something special tonight.</div>
<div class="speaker">The BOY</div>
<div class="dialogue">Frito pie.</div>
<div class="speaker">FATHER</div>
<div class="dialogue">I don't know. She didn't say-</div>
<div class="speaker">The BOY</div>
<div class="delivery">(cutting him off)</div>
<div class="dialogue">It's Frito pie.</div>
<div class="description">Silence. Father stares at him, then looks out the window.</div>
<div class="location">EXT. MANSION - DAY</div>
<div class="description">The Chauffeur helps Father out the car. The Boy jumps out and walks toward the front of his home.&nbsp;The Mansion is dope.&nbsp;Very Big, and not gaudy.&nbsp;It looks classic.</div>
<div class="location">INT. MANSION - DAY</div>
<div class="description">An infinity pool lines the horizon in the backyard. A spiral staircase fades up the wall and into the master bedroom upstairs. You can see all of this from the foyer, which has a large Buddha statue in the center of it. The place is very clean. Someone seems to care or is paid to care.</div>
<div class="description">The Father's phone rings:</div>
<div class="speaker">FATHER</div>
<div class="dialogue">Hello.</div>
<div class="speaker">PHONE VOICE</div>
<div class="dialogue">Hello, this is the Califax collection-</div>
<div class="description">Father hangs up. His cell phone goes off.</div>
<div class="description">The Boy walks into the kitchen. It's a big kitchen. There's a chef making food. He waves to The Boy. The Boy throws up a deuce. He gets a s'more Pop tart, then walks back out.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="location">INT. BOY'S ROOM - DAY</div>
<div class="description">The Boy walks in and drops his backpack and jacket in the doorway. He kicks off his shoes. They fly across the room, hit the wall, and fall in a pile of shoes on the ground.&nbsp;We see there's a big black/brown stain on the wall where The Boy's been kicking shoes for years. Doesn't look like he ever wears the same shoe twice.</div>
<div class="description">The Boy rips the bag of pop tarts open with his mouth as he sits at his desk and opens his laptop. There's a picture of a woman holding a child. She's wearing one of those fly tracksuits from 1995. The ones people wore a lot during the centennial Olympics. &nbsp;</div>
<div class="description">He starts checking his mail. His friend "FAM" sent him something that says "this is you" with a link.&nbsp;The Boy clicks the link and a video of a woman blowing a horse comes up. The Boy watches the video for longer than you should watch a horse blowing video. He closes the video.</div>
<div class="description">He goes onto HOTNEWHIPHOP.COM. There's a new Rich Homie Quan song out. It's listed as "VERY HOTTTTTTT". The Boy looks in the comment section, reading what people are saying.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="description"><i>"This nigga sound like a broke-ass Future! [CRYING EMOJI]"</i> is the top comment.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="description">The Boy stares. Then types "fuck u niggers" in the comments.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="newline"><br></div>
<div class="description">He waits. He takes a bite out of his pop tart.</div>
<div class="newline"><br></div>
<div class="description">He refreshes the page. People immediately respond with "Fuck U", "You wouldn't say that to my face faggot", and "LMFAO crackers b crazy"</div>
<div class="description">The Boy smiles.</div>

<div class="location">INT. THE BOY'S ROOM - EARLY MORNING</div>
<div class="video" vimeo-desktop="82348738" vimeo-mobile="82349635"></div>
<div class="description">The room is an elegant mess. There's shit everywhere, but everything has its place. Classic furniture; someone with old money would invest in, is used for the bed, desk, desk chair. You can see from where most of the trash accumulates that the occupant spends most of his time on the computer.</div>
<div class="description">There is a pile of stacked and flattened gummy bear wrappers by the desk. There's a picture of The Boy and his father on the boy's desk, along with a flash drive that has "hackz" written on it. A small vaporizer charges and glows green on the edge. There's a half ounce of weed in a plastic bag to the left of the laptop on the desk.</div>
<div class="description">There's a black and white Bill Withers poster, a Gorillaz "Demon Days" poster, and a "Black Dynamite" poster. All framed. Stacks of records are placed on a shelf lining the wall. There are some old 70's soul records by a record player on the shelf. Norman Connors "You Are My Starship" is the album on top of the others.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="description">Little hills of dirty clothes grow up the walls from the floor.&nbsp;Same pile of shoes is there.&nbsp;Wall with same dirty spot. The closet is filled with white shirts and flower shorts. There's one very old and tattered Shearling coat that hangs to the right.</div>
<div class="description">The Boy (more a man now) is sprawled out on his bed, no shirt and flower shorts. He opens one eye as very faint, dark orange sunlight from the blinds cut his face. He gets up.</div>
<div class="location">INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY</div>
<div class="description">The Buddha statue again. There's empty old beer and Pellegrino bottles on the bar. The entire back of the living room wall is glass. The boy walks briskly to the kitchen.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="location">INT. KITCHEN - DAY</div>
<div class="description">The kitchen is a slight mess. Things left out. S'mores makings left out. The marshmallows are hard as stones. The boy goes into the cabinet and pulls out a pop tart. He takes out a pop tart and throws it in the microwave, wrapper still on (you're not supposed to do that). He starts the microwave and begins texting someone. The microwave is okay for about 5 seconds, then blue sparks start to pop inside. He turns off the microwave, opens it, grabs the pop tart and tosses it on a plate.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="location">EXT. BACKYARD - EARLY MORNING</div>
<div class="description">The Boy walks onto the little island in the middle of the infinity pool lining the oceans and mountains in the background. The mountains are surrounded by clouds. They're literally above the clouds. It's probably raining down there. There's an orchard with lemon and plums to the west of the wall outside, and a green statue of a golfer further in. Bunnies jump on the lawn in the background.</div>
<div class="description">The boy sits under a sun umbrella, opens the pop tart and starts to eat it. He looks off with his face flat. He gets a text message:</div>
<div class="description">FAM: when u wanna paddle out? [PURPLE DEVIL FACE EMOJI]</div>
<div class="description">The Boy texts back: pick me up</div>
<div class="cuts">CUT TO:</div>
<div class="location">EXT. MANSION FRONT DRIVEWAY - MORNING</div>
<div class="description">An old, red (a gross red. a weak red) Mazda rolls up to the front of the mansion and sputters to a stop. FAM, steps out of the car. Daps up.</div>

<div class="location">INT. GARAGE - MORNING</div>
<div class="description">The garage door rises to reveal Fam and The Boy's silhouette. Five cars are in the garage. There's a Tesla Model S, Silver 911, some car no one's ever seen, a Tahoe and some car under a tarp. Looks like it could be an Aston Martin. Fam smiles.</div>

<div class="speaker">The BOY</div>
<div class="dialogue">The beamer.</div>
<div class="description">We didn't even see this one. It's in the far corner of the garage. It's a nice car. Older, but nice and sleek. Understated, to some. Its black paint is chipping in the front. Fam shakes his head.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="speaker">FAM</div>
<div class="dialogue">Nah...nah.</div>
<div class="description">They get in the 911.</div>
<div class="cuts">CUT TO:</div>

<div class="location">EXT. SANTA MONICA CONDOS - DAY</div>
<div class="description">The 911 pulls up to a nice condo complex. Fam honks the horn for a while. Like a jerk.</div>

<div class="dialogue">I work nights, dickhead!</div>
<div class="speaker">FAM</div>
<div class="dialogue">I know. Fuck me, right?</div>
<div class="description">Fam honks more.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="description">The Boy checks his Twitter feed.&nbsp;Twitter name "You Are Unimportant - @thegoldmolar" You can see from his feed he just trolls all the time. Politicians, athletes, entertainers, etc. His favorite was simply re-tweeting something someone says. When it was dumb enough to just re-tweet, that was his favorite.&nbsp;He'd gotten a lot of followers that way. Written an article once for a blog. Got more followers. He started posting videos of homeless people and fights.</div>
<div class="description">He was looking for something to retweet on his time-line. People say dumb shit all the time...</div>
<div class="description">...someone tweeted "roscoe's wetsuit".&nbsp;</div>
<div class="newline"><br></div>
<div class="description"><b><i>"...what's that?"</i></b></div>
<div class="newline"><br></div>
<div class="description">The Boy drops "roscoe's wetsuit" into Google. A Yahoo answer comes up for it.&nbsp;The answer to "what is roscoe's wetsuit?" is..."roscoe's wetsuit". Hilarious.</div>
<div class="description">SWANK, STEVE, MARCUS (Chance the Rapper), and AJ (STEFAN) walk out of the condo. They have longboards with them and they're eating candy. They stop in their tracks when they see the 911.</div>

<div class="speaker">MARCUS</div>
<div class="dialogue">Cause no one is getting up at 6AM to go into the freezing, dirty ass ocean, fuck up their hair-</div>

<div class="description">Little creatures slowly start to march out from the kitchen. Some have banners that say "HAPPY MARRIAGE!".&nbsp;Some have sparklers.&nbsp;They all bounce on beat. It's cute for a very short moment.&nbsp;Then it feels wrong. &nbsp;</div>
<div class="description">All the creatures have two legs, two arms, like humans. &nbsp;But they are definitely not humans. One of the giveaways being that they are naked, but don't seem to have genitals.&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div class="description">All the creatures are breathing heavy out their mouths (their noses being two tiny slits probably don't allow for heavy air traffic).</div>
<div class="description">They're about three feet high. Their eyes are larger than they should be and are spread farther on their faces. They don't have hair anywhere on their bodies. They all have forced smiles on their faces. You can see their teeth are just a little too sharp when they smile.&nbsp;Insinuating carnivorous behavior.&nbsp;If they wanted to, at any point they could jump on you and rip out your throat in .8 seconds. But they're not right now.&nbsp;They're marching.</div>
<div class="description">One of the creatures has tears in its eyes.&nbsp;Still smiling tho. Pushing the smile.</div>
<div class="description">Everyone is smiling as they march past, but they're all very cautious.&nbsp;Clearly worried that one may attack. The Boy watches as the creatures reach the front of the party and form a circle. They do this weird clapping, almost step team routine, then stop.&nbsp;The music stops.</div>

<div class="description">The Boy continues hitting things.&nbsp;He's about to come down on somoeone's phone that's lying on the coffee table. He holds the pool cue above his head and lets it down fast.</div>
<div class="description">But right before, someone grabs the cell phone, laying their hand on top of it, daring The Boy to hit the hand. The Boy barely stops in time.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="description">The hand has a cast on it.&nbsp;The Boy looks up to see a girl (NAOMI) staring at him.&nbsp;She looks mad.&nbsp;The Boy is mad.&nbsp;But not at her.&nbsp;He's trying to look mad at her, but he really looks like "sorry". &nbsp;</div>

<div class="description">She slowly takes her phone, making complete eye contact the entire time, then walks out.&nbsp;Everyone stares at this strange interaction.</div>

<div class="description">The Boy stands there for a moment.&nbsp;He turns to the bar next to the pool table.&nbsp;There's half a blunt and a bottle of Sriracha sitting there.&nbsp;The Boy takes the bottle and starts squirting it on the pool table.</div>

<div class="description">The Boy lays in his bed. Blue and black stripes from the shades fold over his face. He can hear raccoons scurrying outside.</div>
<div class="description">He sees a spider in the corner of the room.&nbsp;Just sitting in its web.</div>
<div class="description">The Boy doesn't particularly like or dislike spiders.&nbsp;They're everywhere in the house.&nbsp;It's a big house and it's right next to a reserve. But something about this spider sitting there...it really bothers him.&nbsp;It makes him mad. He can hear the spider. Just sitting there. Getting louder.</div>
<div class="description">I'm going to describe it as emotional tinnitus: when everything is silent and quiet, you can see the empty web you're in.&nbsp;It is annoying.&nbsp;Which is the slowest form of torture.</div>

<div class="description">He parks his car.</div>
<div class="video" vimeo-desktop="80662505" vimeo-mobile="80669322"></div>
<div class="description">Then, barefoot, he sits on the roof of his car and watches the cars pass.&nbsp;Bright lights grow to an explosion then fade out as they pass.&nbsp;He goes into his pocket and holds the "hackz" flash drive that we saw on his desk at the beginning.</div>
<div class="description">Someone spray painted "ROSCOE'S WETSUIT" on the side of the bridge.&nbsp;The Boy is not surprised.&nbsp;It's not making more sense, but it's becoming more dependable, which is always nice.</div>

<div class="location">INT. MANSION - NIGHT</div>
<div class="description">The Boy walks through the house; locking all the doors and turning off all the lights.&nbsp;It's always a weird feeling to walk around the house at night because most of the walls are glass, so people can see right inside, especially when it's dark.&nbsp;It's pretty hard to even get to the house, it's the highest home on the hill and there's a long winding road before .&nbsp;But at the same time, if someone got up there, it'd be easy to figure out how to get in.</div>
<div class="description">All the lights are off now.</div>
<div class="description">The Boy walks over to The Buddha in the middle of the foyer.&nbsp;He sits on the floor next to him with his knees to his chest. Looking out the front door into half the darkness and half his reflection.&nbsp;He used to be terrified of this Buddha.&nbsp;When he was little, he'd run behind the statue like it would jump on him as soon as he past.&nbsp;But He slowly became something like a best friend.&nbsp;Something like that.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="location">INT. THE BOY'S ROOM - NIGHT</div>
<div class="description">The Boy pours Pelligrino into a wine glass.&nbsp;Then he continues to twist his metal weed grinder in his hand.&nbsp;He takes the top off the grinder and pours the white powder inside the glass.&nbsp;He drinks it, then sits on the foot of the bed and takes off his white T-shirt.</div>
<div class="description">Pulling the covers over his body, he looks at the spider in the corner...only it was gone. Where'd it go? Why would it leave? What about its parents? Won't they be sad?

<div class="description">Sitcom laughs always freaked him out.&nbsp;Because most of those people are dead.&nbsp;Those are <i>ghost laughs</i>.&nbsp;Laughs that are supposed to be gone forever linger on earth after every mid 90s joke about teenage sex or someone saying "don't go there". Looking for their mouths, never finding them because they're gone. The laughs don't feel good because they're dead laughs.&nbsp;Those laughs aren't what they stood for anymore.&nbsp;They've been reappropriated.

<div class="location">INT. JET PLANE - EVENING</div>
<div class="description">The Boy lays his head against the plane window, the oil from his hair leaving grease smudges all over the window.</div>
<div class="description">His father died in Stockholm.&nbsp;A family member was needed. Didn't realize that they were each other's only family til this very moment.&nbsp;When you lose that, you basically lose most of your memories, at least the accuracy of your own memories.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="description">He wanted to be cremated. &nbsp;</div>
<div class="description">The Boy didn't really know anyone in Stockholm, but he also didn't want to be in his hotel room with his father for a day.&nbsp;Even if he was just ashes.&nbsp;So he decided to search through his followers for someone from Sweden. &nbsp;</div>
<div class="description">Some girl named "Hello_Pity_" Dm'd him back and they were supposed to meet up after all the whatever he had to do.  Her profile bio said she was half french. She looked pretty in her avi: an inverted Hello Kitty.  But that really doesn't mean anything at all, especially since her instagram was blocked, which is something he's learned not to trust at all.</div>
<div class="description">So he looked through her tweets, figured out a night she went to a club, used one of his dummy profiles and pretended that they'd met at the club that night.&nbsp;She had trouble remembering because, according to her feed, she was "fuckin turnt, [CRAZY TONGUE OUT EMOJI] lol". She added this made up dude as a friend on Facebook. Now The Boy could see her pictures.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="description">The rest of her pictures confirmed she was indeed pretty.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="description">This girl loves Justin Bieber though. New Justin Bieber.&nbsp;The "fuck you" Bieber. She loves Justin Bieber in the way you love that girl on Maury who's like "my favorite flavor popsicle is DICK!", which is close to sincere love, but nowhere near it at the same time.</div>

<div class="description">This is the part where they kinda fall in love a little bit.&nbsp;But I feel like anything we put here wouldn't do justice to what really happens when a person you meet ends up in your life out of nowhere.&nbsp;But know that it's exactly how you expect it to be, but also more.&nbsp;It's a big inside joke that you can't mess up and only one other person in the world gets.</div>
<div class="description">It's not a very pretty or perfect love, or even necessarily a romantic love.&nbsp;It doesn't look cool. &nbsp;It's more like two helpless things in the wild, and one says "I'll protect you", and both parties know it's a lie because there's no way either of them can protect the other from anything.&nbsp;That lie is the best way to describe this love.&nbsp;That feeling of not having to say "I'm scared", because you share the exact feelings without having words over or under complicate it, that's worth more than protection.&nbsp;It's a connection.&nbsp;The less alone.&nbsp;This is all we look for on earth. &nbsp;</div>
<div class="description">The Boy and Naomi hang a lot.&nbsp;They spend the night and make breakfast sometimes.&nbsp;He buys stuff for her. She makes him stuff.&nbsp;They watch cartoons together. They're always saying things, giving opinions, feeling interesting. They both have a purpose. It's a great time.&nbsp;Time passes.</div>
<div class="description">The Boy starts moving small amounts of weed out the mansion, but starts selling more to keep up, along with stuff that isn't weed.&nbsp;He started growing crop in the nursery.&nbsp;The electricity bill would be high, but he stopped living in the mansion. He started renting another place to stay and keep the business separate. &nbsp;</div>
<div class="description">To be honest it was getting a little out of hand, as Naomi predicted.&nbsp;The Boy is not a good dealer.&nbsp;A lot of people think you have to be cold and calculated, which he was to an extent.&nbsp;But you also have to know people.&nbsp;How they act/react.&nbsp;But it was still kinda fun up to this point.</div>

<div class="description">The Boy sits in the living room.&nbsp;Maybe he could run out the back?&nbsp;Where though?&nbsp;They're at the top of a mountain.&nbsp;If someone heard a shot in this neighborhood, they'd call the police immediately.&nbsp;Unfortunately, there isn't a police department in the Palisades.&nbsp;He'd be waiting for the Santa Monica department, which would take a minute.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="description">The feeling The Boy had now was shockingly similar to the feeling he got at his own parties.&nbsp;People he didn't know or like casually walking through his home and him having to pretend everything is "fine", or that they don't have all the power.</div>
<div class="description">Maybe he could text Fam.</div>

<div class="description">Two dudes stand guard at the front and back exits.&nbsp;One dude packs the bricks from the closet in a trash bag.&nbsp;Dude 1 (seems to be the leader) is looking through The Boy's phone. &nbsp;</div>
<div class="description">It didn't feel like the day The Boy was going to die.&nbsp;Not to say The Boy didn't feel like he was going to die, he was certain he was going to die today.&nbsp;But he didn't feel like today felt like a/the last day/night.&nbsp;Like a Wednesday that keeps feeling like a Friday.&nbsp;But the more he thought about it, if the last day felt like the last day, the world would be a different place.&nbsp;The order we have everyday would vanish if you were guaranteed a warning.&nbsp;People wouldn't live like they do.&nbsp;They wouldn't care what you thought.&nbsp;It'd be anarchy.&nbsp;Or a utopia.&nbsp;Depending on who you ask.</div>
<div class="description">Dude 1 puts The Boy's phone in his pocket.&nbsp;The Boy doesn't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. Dude 1 and Dude 2 start talking.&nbsp;It's obvious they're discussing The Boy's fate.</div>
<div class="description">If I was the director, the one who made this moment, the one who saw this moment millennia before, the one who coded this world and allowed this to happen, I'd have Thundercat's "We'll Die" playing as The Boy looks around at his once castle.</div>
